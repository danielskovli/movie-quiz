# Movie quiz
Extremely simple console based quiz game with no external dependencies.

The game takes a list of movie titles and generates a quiz by scrambling the letters and asking the user to guess what the original title was. 

Useful as a general Python demo, or workshop icebreaker, or... well it's not very useful. I just wanted to make it and I'm now trying to justify its existence.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Usage
Modify the [movies.txt](moviex.txt) file as required, then execute the script:
```cmd
# Option 1:
python movie_quiz.py

# Option 2:
./movie_quiz.py

(requires execute privileges and the existence of `/usr/bin/python3`)
```
